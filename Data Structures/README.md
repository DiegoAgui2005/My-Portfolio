# Data Structures and Processing 🧠🐍

This folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook labs completed for the course **Data Structures and Processing** at Constructor University.  
Most of the work was developed using **Python**, with one lab incorporating **basic SQL queries** for structured data access.
